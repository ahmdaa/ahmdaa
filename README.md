# More about me
- You'll usually find me tinkering with or watching videos of a coding language in my free time. It's how I gained most of my knowledge!
- I like playing, watching, analyzing and making videogames of all kinds. Very invested in the field.
- I really like sushi rolls and cheesecake.

I will be using this repository for a personal website in the future!
